# TCP State Machine — Annotated

The eleven states from RFC 793 §3.2 / RFC 9293 §3.3.2, and exactly
where each transition is implemented. Every transition below is one
`match` arm (or one branch within an arm) in `process_segment()`,
the private function in `src/tcp.rs` that `TcpTable::handle_segment()`
dispatches into per-connection.

## Transition table

| Transition | RFC section | Where in `src/tcp.rs` |
|---|---|---|
| `CLOSED → LISTEN` | RFC 9293 §3.10.1 | `TcpTable::listen()` — registers `(addr, port)` in `listeners`, no `TcpConnection` exists yet |
| `LISTEN → SYN_RCVD` | RFC 9293 §3.10.7.2 | `TcpTable::handle_segment()`'s "no existing connection, SYN to a listening port" branch |
| `CLOSED → SYN_SENT` | RFC 9293 §3.10.1 (active open) | `TcpTable::connect()` |
| `SYN_SENT → ESTABLISHED` | RFC 9293 §3.10.7.3 | `process_segment()`, `TcpState::SynSent` arm, on `SYN,ACK` whose `ack_num == snd_nxt` |
| `SYN_RCVD → ESTABLISHED` | RFC 9293 §3.10.7.4 | `process_segment()`, `TcpState::SynRcvd` arm, on `ACK` whose `ack_num == snd_nxt`; also enqueues the connection into `accept_queues` here |
| `ESTABLISHED →` data transfer | RFC 9293 §3.10.7.4 | `TcpState::Established` arm → `receive_data_and_maybe_fin()` (in-order delivery, out-of-order buffering, FIN detection) + `flush_send()` (window-limited send) |
| `ESTABLISHED → FIN_WAIT_1` | RFC 9293 §3.10.4 (local close) | `TcpTable::close()` marks `pending_close`; `flush_send()` sends the FIN and makes the transition once `send_pending` has actually drained (immediately, if nothing was queued) |
| `ESTABLISHED → CLOSE_WAIT` | RFC 9293 §3.10.7.4 (remote FIN) | `TcpState::Established` arm, when `receive_data_and_maybe_fin()` reports the FIN was consumed |
| `FIN_WAIT_1 → FIN_WAIT_2` | RFC 9293 §3.10.7.5 | `TcpState::FinWait1` arm, `our_fin_acked && !fin` |
| `FIN_WAIT_1 → CLOSING` | RFC 9293 §3.10.7.5 (simultaneous close) | `TcpState::FinWait1` arm, `!our_fin_acked && fin` |
| `FIN_WAIT_1 → TIME_WAIT` | RFC 9293 §3.10.7.5 (both at once) | `TcpState::FinWait1` arm, `our_fin_acked && fin` |
| `FIN_WAIT_2 → TIME_WAIT` | RFC 9293 §3.10.7.5 | `TcpState::FinWait2` arm, on remote FIN |
| `CLOSING → TIME_WAIT` | RFC 9293 §3.10.7.5 | `TcpState::Closing` arm, on ACK of our FIN |
| `CLOSE_WAIT → LAST_ACK` | RFC 9293 §3.10.4 | `TcpTable::close()` marks `pending_close`; `flush_send()` makes the transition once `send_pending` has drained, same as the `ESTABLISHED` case above |
| `LAST_ACK → CLOSED` | RFC 9293 §3.10.7.5 | `TcpState::LastAck` arm, on ACK of our FIN |
| `TIME_WAIT → CLOSED` | RFC 9293 §3.10.8 (2 MSL) | `TcpTable::tick()`, deadline check |
| `TIME_WAIT` re-ACKs a duplicate FIN | RFC 9293 §3.10.8 | `TcpState::TimeWait` arm — re-sends the ACK and restarts the timer; this is the one case that *must* still respond, since it exists specifically to handle a lost final ACK |
| any live state → `CLOSED` on incoming `RST` | RFC 9293 §3.10.7 (general case) | `process_segment()` — a single check hoisted above the per-state `match`, so every state (not just `SYN_SENT`/`SYN_RCVD`) aborts the connection on RST |

## Simultaneous open and close

- **Simultaneous close** (both sides call `close()` before either has
  seen the other's FIN) **is handled**: `FIN_WAIT_1`'s branch for
  "remote FIN arrived but our FIN isn't acked yet" goes to `CLOSING`
  rather than assuming a strict half-duplex teardown order. This path
  is exercised directly in `tests/retransmission.rs`, where the
  client and server close at effectively the same simulated instant.
- **Simultaneous open** (both sides send SYN to each other before
  either has sent SYN,ACK, RFC 9293 §3.10.7.3's `SYN_SENT` recv-SYN
  case) is **not implemented**. `process_segment()`'s `TcpState::SynSent`
  arm only handles `SYN,ACK`; a bare `SYN` received in `SYN_SENT` is
  silently ignored rather than transitioning to `SYN_RCVD` and merging
  the two handshakes. This is an explicit, documented scope cut —
  simultaneous open is rare in practice (it requires both peers to
  initiate a connection to each other at the same moment using
  pre-arranged ports) and meaningfully complicates ISN/state
  bookkeeping for a case the project's interoperability goals
  (talking to real `nc`/`curl`/`ping`) never exercise.
- Real TCP stacks also retain a `RST`-on-unexpected-segment behavior
  for unmatched connections; MiniTCP implements a minimal version of
  this (`send_rst_for_unknown()` in `src/tcp.rs`) so a segment
  arriving for a port nobody is listening on gets a `RST,ACK` rather
  than silent drop — visible in the trace as `port N unreachable`.
  That's RST *generation* for a connection that doesn't exist; RST
  *handling* for one that does (a peer resetting a live connection) is
  the separate, uniform check described in the transition table above
  — no sequence/ACK-number validation is applied to it, matching the
  same unconditional acceptance the handshake-only checks it replaced
  already had.

## Why no real congestion control

The README's Phase 5 lists slow-start `cwnd` as an explicit, optional
stretch goal. MiniTCP implements the rest of RFC 6298-style
reliability (single retransmission timer, exponential backoff, capped
retries) but **does not** implement a congestion window — `snd_wnd`
here is purely the *receiver's advertised flow-control window*, never
reduced by a sender-side congestion estimate. Given the project's
scope was already dominated by the state machine, sliding window, and
out-of-order reassembly, a real congestion control algorithm (even
basic slow start, let alone Reno/CUBIC) was cut to keep the surface
area manageable — noted here rather than silently, per the README's
own framing of that task.
